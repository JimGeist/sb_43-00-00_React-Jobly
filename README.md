## Assignment Details

Build a react front-end to the provided Jobly backend. 

**Step Zero: Setup**

**Step One: Design Component Hierarchy**

Interesting. The step was completed, but it's helpfulness is debatable.

**Step Two: Make an API Helper**

The API handler is a class that holds the methods that make the requests from the Jobly backend. 

The Jobly backend has a lot of functionality that will not get implemented in the frontend -- examples are adding a company, adding a position, altering the admin flag. The approach for this piece was to indentify all possbible routes from the backend and add them to the api class as comments / placecholders. The code was impletmented as the respective route was needed.
